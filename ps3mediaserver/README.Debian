ps3mediaserver for Ubuntu
-------------------------

 This package is bundled with all required pre-patched binary tools (ffmpeg, 
 mencoder, tsmuxer, flac, libmediainfo, etc). They will be installed to 
 /usr/lib/ps3mediaserver and are exclusively used by ps3mediaserver.

 Therefore you do not have to install them manually.
