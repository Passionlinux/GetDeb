  * New upstream version

      parts of a piece of furniture.
    * Made resizing of a piece of furniture with its resize indicator
      proportional when shift key is pressed.
    * Moved the viewport of the plan only when selected objects become
      invisible at screen when they are moved with the keyboard.

      to take into account the width of their doorOrWindowCutOutShape
      property when it's smaller.

      apply a scale factor to the user interface of Sweet Home 3D.

      screens under Windows and Linux.

      properties that can be set for Sunflow.

    * Ensured walls created by Plan > Split wall menu item are at the
      same level as the split wall.

      String properties (developers are encouraged to replace calls to
      the deprecated getVisualProperty and setVisualProperty on a Home

      file format might not save visual properties anymore).

      installation process under Windows.
