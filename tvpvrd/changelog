tvpvrd (4.4.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - Added config scripts to allow ivtv driver to work well with
      suspend/hibernate function.
      The ivtv kernel module is not power aware and hence must be
      unloaded before a power event.
      This change adds pm-util config scripts which will
      load/unload the driver properly as well as having the daemon
      reinitialize the HW when the system is woken up again.

    - Added 'ic' command to allow the adjusting the image parameters
      (saturation, contrast, hue and brightness) in the video stream.
      Each card can be individually tuned.

    - Added 'ac' command to allow adjusting of audio controls (bass and
      treble)

    - Added 'va' command to allow volume adjusting

    - Added settings in config file to adjust image and audio user controls
      default value (contrast,sat,hue,brightness,treble,bass,volume) The same
      settings are applied to all installed cards.

    Bugs fixed:
    - None (no bugs reported or detected)

    Internal changes:
    - Some spell checking in code comments

    - Updated build environment to use automake 1.12.1 and autoconfig 2.69

tvpvrd (3.3.5-1~getdeb1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - The history XML DB now includes human readable version of the start and
      end times. This makes it easier to use a XSL stylesheets to display the
      DB directly in browser. Otherwise a timestamp conversion must be
      carried out in XSL which requires EXSL to be within reason.
      Unfortunately very few browsers implement EXSL directly so the
      timestamp would force conversion to HTML via for example 'xsltproc'
      first.
    - Added XSL stylesheet to view history directly in editor
    - Added nice HTML formatting when sending history in mail

    Bugs fixed:
    - Problem with timeout in the 'rhm' (Mail history command) command due to
      missing newline.

    Internal changes:
    - Refactored CSS handling of tables to its own module (listhtml.c/.h)

tvpvrd (3.3.4-1~getdeb1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - Added check at startup that all specified channels in the
      station/channel alias file (e.g. xawtv) really exists in the frequency
      map used. Give a fatal error in case of error.
    - "List all" now uses the same format for the listing as as "List single"
      and "List repeat" commands. (This has bother my esthetic side for a
      long time!)

    Bugs fixed:
    - None.

    Internal changes:
    - None.

tvpvrd (3.3.3-1~getdeb1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - Accept both "exit" and "quit" to quit from shell.
    - Added list header for 'lh' command, improved list layout.
    - Adjusted profile settings for tnormal and thigh profiles.

    Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed a wrong "No recordings" text at end of listing
      of single recordings in one circumstance
      (when only one recording exists). 

    Internal changes:
    - Read startup script before XML database is read.
    - Adjusted some modules startup order to be able to get
      log printout even earlier in startup phase.
    - Add a longer delay (sleep) in startup if the daemon detect
      it is started at the same time as the server is powered on
      to allow all fs remote mounts to finish safely before the
      daemon tries to access the file system.

tvpvrd (3.3.0-1~getdeb1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - Added "today" as option in dropdown instead of blank
    - Improved history formatting
    - To finish the command line both "quit" and "exit" can be used
    - Web interface empty weekday (meaning today) changed to "today"
    - Upgraded handling of ffmpeg to a newer version. This means changes
      in the profile handling of max video rate as well as the h264 naming
      of the preset files. By default to make it more compatible with various
      ffmpeg versions the default preset is now empty.
      This also removes support for older versions of ffmpeg. Stick with
      v3.2.1 if you are using older versions of ffmpeg.

    Bugs fixed:
    - None 

    Internal changes:
    - Added additional error check to catch the case when a remote file server
      where we store recordings and database is not responding properly

    Bugs fixed:
        - Fixed critical segfault crash in shutdown check when
          the recording queue happened to be empty.

    Bugs fixed:
        - None.
    
    Internal changes:
        - Code cleanup to pass cleanly with new gcc 4.6.0 maximum warnings settings.
          gcc 4.6.0 adds a new warning flag -Wunused-but-set-variable that gave some
          warnings that needed handling.
    
    v3.1.2
    ------
    User visible changes:
        - tvpsh now checks that the server is reachable at
          startup and quits with error if not.
        - Added "external_tuner_station" setting in the config file.
          This will set the tuner input station when external channel
          switching is used and the input is specified as the tuner
          input. Used to connect a cable box with a set
          frequency/channel to the TV-card and changing channels with
          an IR sender on the cable box instead of the tuner in the TV-card.
        - Improved the manual page on how to handle an
          external cable box with IR-sender using the external
          channel switching.
    
    Bugs fixed:
        None.
    
    Internal changes:
        - Fixed compiler warning about set but not used variable
        - Code security review. Make sure all string concatenation
          is explicitely limited.
        - Add full path for killproc/startproc in the SysV init.d scripts 
        - Updated OpenSuSE RPM Spec file

tvpvrd (3.1.1-1~getdeb1) maverick; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    v3.1.1
    ------
    User visible changes:
        None.

    Bugs fixed:
        - Build without warning on amd64 architecture
          (complaints about "%03d" format when "%03zu" should be used)
        - Gracefully handle running tvpsh when no tvpvrd.conf can be found

    Internal changes:
        None.
    v3.1.0
    ------
    User visible changes:
    - Added a real client shell 'tvpsh' program to interact with the
      daemon.
      This have features like full command line editing and  history
      (using GNU readline).
      By allowing the shell to be used as an interactive login shell
      (adding it to /etc/shells) it is possible to create a user that
      will use this shell as the login shell.
      It is then possible to login to the server, for example using ssh,
      as this user to interact with the daemon.
    - Don't give an error on empty command. Just ignore it.
    - Remove the prompt from the pure TCP/IP command since it causes all
      kinds of issues with the real client added to 3.1.0
    - 'lr' command was split into 'lr' and 'lu' command to make the
      commands orthogonal

    Bugs fixed:
    - Don't write the prompt after each timeout in the client interface
    - Added documentation for "mlg" (mail log) command
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0.6 whereby a cancelling request for an
      ongoing recording via the Web interface was not recognized

    Internal changes:
    - Refactored logging routines to it's own source file
    - Each command output now ends with a "\r\n" sequence to indicated
      end of command output
    - Make code compile clean even with -Wshadow flag added. The code now
      compiles clean with gcc flags:
      -pedantic -Wall -Werror -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes
      -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat=2

    v3.0.6
    ------
    User visible changes:
    - Added use_mobile flag in the config file to allow user
      to determine if the modified phone WEB-UI should be used
      or not when connection from a phone is detected.
    - Added string "(tvpvrd) " as prompt for the TCP/IP interface
    - If a transcoding is forced to stop by user then keep the
      original MP2 file and directory in the vtmp directory.
    - Add "mlg - mail log file" command which will send the
      entire logfile in a mail to the predefined system
      mail address. The logfile is sent as an attachment.

    Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed CSS issue that caused the link in the last two
      menu items not to be active
    - Fixed bug where the wrong min shutdown time was
      read from the config file (copy&paste error)

    Internal changes:
    - Changed command format in URL string
    - Logger now eliminates repeated messages and just prints
      how many of the same message

tvpvrd (3.0.5-1~getdeb1) maverick; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    User visible changes:
    - Optimized Web-GUI minute list to better match start
      and end times often used
    - Added 'lm' command. Will mail the list of recordings
      (in both plain and HTML format) to the email address
      specified to receive mails.
      The format of the HTML mail is controlled by CSS
      styles and adjustable in the config file in the "format" section
    - Added hyper-linked transcoding profiles in the Web-interface to
      allow easy viewing of profile details
    - Added 'lmr' command - Send repeat and single recordings in
      HTML format in a mail
    - Added 'lr' command list repeating and single recordings
      in text format
    - Updated menu structure in Web-interface to include the
      mailing commands 'lm' and 'lmr'

    Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed a bug whereby if a recurring recording had the new
      type Tue-Fri (7) it gave an error when the server was restarted
      and claimed it was an unrecognized recurring type. This was a 
      false alarm since the range check had not been updated to
      reflect this new type.

    - None.

tvpvrd (3.0.3-1~getdeb1) maverick; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    v3.0.3
    ------
    User visible changes:
        - Added 'df' = 'Display used and total disk space' command
        - Added information on disk usage in transcoding notification mail
        (updated mail templates)

    Internal changes:
        - None.


    v3.0.2
    ------
    User visible changes:
        - Fix an issue introduced in the last minute for 3.0.0 which could
        wrongly find colliding
          recordings even when multiple video cards where available. Lessons
          learned: Never ,never
          do a "simple" change before a release ...

    Internal changes:
        - Added some more verbose debug output with time stamp translation.
        - Added a sanity check when reading the database to detect errors in
        time specification.


    v3.0.1
    ------
    User visible changes:
        - Fix some minor build issues specific to a x86_64 platform

    Internal changes:
        - None.

    v3.0.0
    ------
    User visible changes:
        - Update XML DB format.
            -- Removed the specific "video" field. This is not necessary.
            Better to assign new
               video cards when the DB file is read at startup. This will
               also make it possible
               to dynamically add and remove video cards while still
               maintaining an optimal
               recording schedule (as far as permitted).
            -- Bumped DB version to "2". Any existing version "1" DBs will be
            automatically updated.

        - Added new flag for configure "--enable-stacktrace"
          This will help with remote end user debugging (if ever needed) when
          they cannot create
          a core dump.  If enabled a stacktrace will be stored in a file,
          '/tmp/tvpvrd_stack.crash'
          (hardcoded name), when the daemon receives a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS
          signal. Added "-rdynamic"
          as a compiler switch to force better stack traces. This is not as
          complete as a full
          gdb trace (with all threads) but better than nothing if this is
          ever needed (knock on
          wood...)

        - Update of the CSS for mobile browsing for better readability

        - Added "af - Add recordings from file" command to make it possible
        to prepare a list
          of recordings offline

        - Added configuration option "use_repeat_rec_basedir" to have all
        repeated
          recordings for the same show stored under a subdirectory named
          after the
          base-name of the recording (i.e. without all the date and repeat
          information).

        - Don't ship a 'tvpvrd.conf' file directly. Instead ship two template
        files for the config
          'tvpvrd.conf.simplified.template' and 'tvpvrd.conf.full.template'
          which will force the user
          to at least once check them and rename them to 'tvpvrd.conf'. The
          two template files
          corresponds to a simplified config file relying mostly on the
          default values and one
          template file with all the settings spelled out. This has been done
          as a feeble try to
          simplify the setup.

        - Added template based mail setup for shutdown and transcoding mails

        - Added a basic SMTP mail sending library to allow for more advanced
        formatting of mails

        - Updated INSTALL file with some information on extra steps needed
          if building directly from the repository

        - Added --with-libpcre-prefix option to "configure" to allow user to
        specify
          alternative locations for PCRE library

        - Added possibility to run a user supplied startup script and added a
          suitable template for such a script.

        - Added option to send HTML formatted mail notifications. The 
        templates
          for the mails are stored in the configuration directory.

        - Added option to use specified SMTP server directly to send mail

        - Updated template for hook scripts

        - Added post transcoding script hook and associated template in
        config

        - Changed structure of config file so that all mail related settings
        are in
          its own section.

        - Fixed a memory leak when CSS file was not modified when using the
        WEB-interface

    Internal changes:
        - The login cookie used now restricts itself to only use characters
        from
          0-9A-Xa-z_ to allow the cookies to pass through some over
          restricting
          WebProxys which filters out cookies with character outside this
          range.
          In addition the cookie header no longer adds the "Version"
          attribute
          since, again, some proxys will filter out the cookie if this
          attribute
          is included. (This is most likely user visible as well)

        - Fix a possible buffer overwrite when converting cookies to URL
        character
          escaped encoding

        - Some further code refactoring to reduce size of 'tvpvrsrv.c'

        - Improved the usability of the key/val replacement routines

        - Cleaned up header inclusions

        - Some internal code restructuring to reduce the size of the main
        tpvrsrv.c
          file by creating vcard.c/vcard.h and some other move of code to
          more appropriate
          places.

        - Some include header streamlining

        - Update network code to use the more modern getaddrinfo() system
        call

        - Reworked he build system so that iniparser is now an archive
        library

        - Added base64 and quoted-printable functionality since that is
        needed for mails

        - Added SIGABRT handler to get some notifications when using glibs
        memory
          checking routines MALLOC_CHECK

        - Changed configuration so ininparser is built as a proper library.
        Makes the
          build scripts slightly cleaner.

        - Refactored all xstr* routines to there own source module


    v2.3.0 [r377]
    -------------
    User visible changes:
        - Added automatic shutdown in the server itself by making use of the
        BIOS
          real time clock. This will power off the daemon until its time for
          next
          recording.

        - Give WEB user the login page instead of not found if he/she is not
        logged
          in and gives an invalid command.

        - Slightly increase the quality in the default profiles with
        increased bitrate.
          (disk space i cheap)

        - Add some missing information in the list settings command

        - Updated documentation (man pages) to reflect changes

    Internal changes:
        - Internal code restructuring and refactoring in preparation for more
        advanced
          mail processing as well as easier maintenance
        - Increase allowed bps range for video ffmpeg encoding
        - Reduce complexity of the utils module
