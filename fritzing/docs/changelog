draw traces directly in pcb view traces aren't automatically cleared when there
are changes to the board (deleting parts or connections still removes traces)
export-etchable (was export diy) bug fixes simple text notes spanish
translation (thanks to Kurt Badelt) some new and improved parts check for
updates new examples

Jan. 21, 2009

Interim release 0.1.14b

swapping was broken in 0.1.13b

Jan. 20, 2009

Interim release 0.1.13b

two bug fixes around delete:

  • delete followed by view switch was crashing
  • delete followed by undo in pcb view was generating phantom parts

Jan. 18, 2009

Interim release 0.1.12b

  • fixed some cases in which the autorouter was incorrectly unable to route a
    trace

    eliminate some of the unnecessary zig-zags
  • the connection currently being traced is now highlighted
  • there's a 'stop this trace' button (next to the cancel autoroute button).
    if the autorouter gets stuck for too long on a particular trace (or you can
    see from the highlight that the trace would be blocked), clicking 'stop
    this trace' turns the current trace into a jumper wire, and the autorouter
    goes on to the next trace.

Jan. 17, 2009

Interim release 0.1.11b

New stuff

  • Bill of materials export (to text file)
  • Simple labels for parts (more UI work to be done)

  • Autorouter: Routing stopped before completion (certain parts were
    mistakenly treated as having buses)
  • Autorouter: Shift-click to remove bendpoint on traces crash
  • Export DIY: Wires not lined up propertly with parts they were connected to
  • Export DIY: Certain parts disappeared from export
  • Delete/undo bug causing view desynchronization
  • Part bug fixes on Optocoupler, Transistors

  • IC part generator (so far only for experts, in the SVN)
  • ...and a number of further fixes and enhancements

Dec. 23, 2008

Main release 0.1b

The "Fritzmas" release is the first version of the new Fritzing that we tend to
call stable. We put a lot of effort into polishing, bug fixing, performance
improvements and future-proofness (which also means that sketches created with
older versions are not compatible with the new one).
We intend to circulate it on a wider base and are encouraging you to try it out
on more serious projects.

  • (Hopefully) clearer UI: We put some effort in making the "three
    views"-concept more understandable, with a new view switcher, miniature
    views in the navigator, cross-view icons in the inspector, and a new help
    text on opening Fritzing for the first time.
  • New website: Based on a new underlying web framework (Django), the new
    website is the foundation for the upcoming social features. Soon you will
    be able to share projects and custom parts.
  • Refined .fz file format that is (more likely) future-compatible
  • New parts (big potentiometer, batteries, dc motor) and lots of clean-up
  • Five new example sketches, including a Fritzmas surprise
  • Improved synchronization of views (especially for schematic view)
  • New overall design and styling, with much more space for your sketch
  • Big speed-up for the breadboard
  • Export DIY is now vector-based and faster
  • Improved autorouter
  • Breadboard parts resized to be closer to actual size
  • Parts editor connectors view allows for zooming and panning
  • Connectors, connections, buses, and wires cleaned up
  • Autorouting can now be undone
  • ..and many more big and small bug fixes
