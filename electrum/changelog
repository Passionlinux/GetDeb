electrum (2.9.0-1~getdeb1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    * Multiple Chain Validation: Electrum will download and validate
     block headers sent by servers that may follow different branches
     of a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of a linear sequence,
     block headers are organized in a tree structure. Branching points
     are located efficiently using binary search. The purpose of MCV is
     to detect and handle blockchain forks that are invisible to the
     classical SPV model.
     * The desired branch of a blockchain fork can be selected using the
     network dialog. Branches are identified by the hash and height of
     the diverging block. Coin splitting is possible using RBF
     transaction (a tutorial will be added).
     * Multibit support: If the user enters a BIP39 seed (or uses a
     hardware wallet), the full derivation path is configurable in the
     install wizard.
     * Option to send only confirmed coins
     * Qt GUI:
     - Network dialog uses tabs and gets updated by network events.
     - The gui tabs use icons
     * Kivy GUI:
     - separation between network dialog and wallet settings dialog.
     - option for manual server entry
     - proxy configuration
     * Daemon: The wallet password can be passed as parameter to the
     JSONRPC API.
     * Various other bugfixes and improvements.

electrum (2.8.0-1~getdeb2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    * Wallet file encryption using ECIES: A keypair is derived from the
    wallet password. Once the wallet is decrypted, only the public key
    is retained in memory, in order to save the encrypted file.
    * The daemon requires wallets to be explicitly loaded before
    commands can use them. Wallets can be loaded using: 'electrum
    daemon load_wallet [-w path]'. This command will require a
    password if the wallet is encrypted.
    * Invoices and contacts are stored in the wallet file and are no
    longer shared between wallets. Previously created invoices and
    contacts files may be imported from the menu.
    * Fees improvements:
    - Dynamic fees are enabled by default.
    - Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) dialog in the GUI.
    - RBF is automatically proposed for low fee transactions.
    * Support for Segregated Witness (testnet only).
    * Support for Digital Bitbox hardware wallet.
    * The GUI shows a blue icon when connected using a proxy.
