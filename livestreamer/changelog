  * New upstream version
        General:
         - All stream names are now forced to lowercase to avoid issues with
           services renaming streams. (#179)
         - Updated requests compatibility to 2.0. (#183)

        Plugins:
         - Added plugin for Hashd.tv by kasper93. (#184)

            - Added support for archived streams (VOD). (#70)
            - Added a option to force legacy stream names (720p, 1080p+,
            etc).
         - UStream.tv: Refactored plugin and added support for their RTMP API
         and
           special streaming technology (UHS). (#144)

        CLI:
         - Added some more player options: ``--player-args``,

         - Expanded ``--stream-sorting-excludes`` to support more advanced
           filtering. (#159)
         - Now notifies the user if a new version of Livestreamer is
         available.
         - Now allows case-insensitive stream name lookup.

        API:
         - Added a new exception (``LivestreamerError``) that all other
         exceptions
           inherit from.
         - The ``sorting_excludes`` parameter in ``Plugin.get_streams``
           now supports more advanced filtering. (#159)
