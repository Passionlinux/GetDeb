livestreamer (1.7.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    CLI:
     - Added a ``--player-no-close`` option.
     - Added options to use HTTP proxies with ``--http-proxy`` and
     ``--https-proxy``.
     - It's now possible to specify multiple streams as a comma-separated
       list. If a stream is not available the next one in the list will be
       tried.
     - Now only resolves synonyms once when using
     ``--player-continuous-http``.
     - Removed the ``-u`` shortcut for ``--plugins``. This is a response to
     someone
       spreading the misinformation that ``-url`` is a sane parameter to use.
       It's technically valid, but due to the ``-u`` shortcut it would be
       interpreted by Python's argparse as ``--plugins --rtmpdump l`` which
       would cause livestreamer to look for a non-existing rtmpdump
       executable,
       thus disabling any RTMP streams. (#193)

    Plugins:
     - Added Afreeca.tv plugin.
     - dailymotion: Fixed incorrect RTMP parameters. (#201)
     - filmon: Updated after service changes. Patch by Athanasios Oikonomou.
     (#205)
     - ilive: Updated after service changes. (#200)
     - livestream: Added support for HLS streams.
     - livestream: Updated after service changes. (#195)
     - mips: Updated after service changes. (#200)
     - svtplay: Fixed some broken HDS streams. (#200)
     - twitch: Updated to use the new HLS API.
     - weeb: Updated after service changes. Patch by Athanasios Oikonomou.
     (#207)
     - youtube: Now handles 3D streams properly. (#202)

    Stream:
     - hds: Added support for global bootstraps.
     - hls: Rewrote the playlist parser from scratch to be more solid and
     correct
       in accordance to the latest M3U8 spec.
     - hls: Now supports playlists using EXT-X-BYTERANGE.
     - hls: Now supports playlists using multiple EXT-X-KEY tags.
     - hls: Now accepts extra requests parameters to be used when doing
       HTTP requests.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bytes-serialization when using ``--json``.
