    PAC did not, has just arrived to PAC Manager (but much better, of course!
    ;) Check out all sample scripts provided, and let your imagination do the
    rest!
    . PAC Scripts are written in Perl, and the built-in editor has syntax
    highlighting (if 'libgtk2-sourceview2-perl' is installed) and checking
    . Modified the DEBIAN package dependencies list: rdesktop,
    xtightvncviewer, cu and remote-tty moved to "Recommended" section of
    Debian package

    output to files
    . Now, if "auto-hide connections list" is checked (on), moving the mouse
    to the left side of terminals will make the tree appering, and reverse

    including patterns! (<IP>, <USER>, <NAME>, <TITLE>, <DATE_Y>, <TIME_H>,
    ...) Checkout tooltips!

    from the saved log file

    be used.

    Terminals ("Preferences" -> "Terminal Options" -> "Prevent F11 from going
    fullscreen")
    . Added a special cluster named " *ALL PAC TERMINALS*", which allow quick
    controlling *every* terminal from PCC, without individually asigning
    Terminals to clusters
    . Added a way to remember PCC's Window latest status (size, position and
    multiline input state)
    . Added an option to remember latest syntax highlighting for multi line
    text entry at PCC
    . Added an option to auto-start a local Shell upon PAC startup.
    . Added a "Restart All" button to PCC, in order to be able to restart
    every clustered terminal (added by petition)

    it does not exist in present linux installation (somewhat, buggy...)
    . Modified the <CMD:...> PAC variable to: echo it's output if multiline
    or sending string for executing into terminal if result is single line
    . Fixed a bug that prevented PAC from using "Private SSH keys" with a
    space on its path
    . Fixed a bug that could make the "Import" phase failing with a
    "Ciphertext does not begin with a valid header for 'salt'..."

        the shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+F)

    then echo -n '<GV:Pasarela_VPN_A>';
    else echo -n '<GV:Pasarela_VPN_B>'; fi">
    Of course, having predefined both "Gateway_A" and "Gateway_B" under
    "Preferences" -> Global Variables ...
    F**K YEAH!!!!!!
    And the same applies to the rest of entry boxes!! (checkout
    <CMD:*> right-clicking over entry boxes)
