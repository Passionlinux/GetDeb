abcl (1.0.1-1~getdeb1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    Changes
    -------

      * Updated ASDF to 2.019

      * User Manual now contains more polished formating from docstring
        groveling, an index of symbols, and additional enhancements.

      * 'abcl.properties.in' now contains examples of optimizing the ABCL
        wrapper script for 64bit instances for Java7 and for Java6.  

      * [r13720] Randomize string hash computation to guard against
        exploits.

      * [r13723] New internal API in Package.java for looking up internal
        vs. external symbols.

    Fixes
    -----

      * [#181][r13718] The implementation now correctly loads ASDF
      definitions
        from jar archives.  This had prevented the ABCL-CONTRIB loading
        mechanism from working.

      * [#177] Made the mechanism for locating the abcl-contrib archive
        more robust

      * [#177] LIST-DIRECTORY no longer ignores :RESOLVE-SYMLINKS

      * [r13706] Fix Streadm.readToken() bug reported by Blake McBride.

      * [#183][r13703] Move threads-jss.lisp out of system source to
        restore conditional recompilation logic.

  * New upstream version

 -- Christoph Korn <christoph.korn@getdeb.net>  Tue, 08 Nov 2011 19:04:29 +0100

abcl (0.27.0-1~getdeb1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    Features
    --------

     * ABCL works as an SBCL build host

     * Huge (> 64k) literal object support (fixes CL-UNICODE support)

     * The ABCL-ASDF contrib allows the specification of JAR-FILE or
       JAR-DIRECTORY components that can be resolved via a PATHNAME.  The
       MVN component bootstraps a Maven3 Aether connector to locally
       replicate a versioned jar artifact for dynamic inclusion in the
       CLASSPATH.

    Changes
    -------

     * Renamed LispObject.writeToString() method to (more Lispy) printObject()

     * New LispObject.princToString() for user readable output

     * Changed behaviour of LispObject.unreadableString() to signal
       errors when *PRINT-READABLY* is non-NIL

     * Static initializers moved to <clinit>() (java: static { }) to
       prevent repeated execution when invoking the constructor multiple times

     * Compiler clean-ups

     * Changed implementation of LABELS to eliminate the need
       to *always* create a closure

     * File compiler (COMPILE-FILE) clean-ups

     * When calling a function with the wrong number of arguments,
       report the expected (range) of arguments

     * Upgraded ASDF to 2.017

     * JSS:JLIST-TO-LIST now converts any java.list.List to a Lisp list.

     * The ASDF extensions from JSS for the "jar-directory", "jar-file",
       and "class-file-directory" types have been refactored into the
       ABCL-ASDF contrib as well as the *ADDED-TO-CLASSPATH* variable
       which records dynamically added dependencies.  Use the
       JSS:ENSURE-COMPATIBILITY function to have JSS include these
       dependencies.  

    *  As long as ABCL-ASDF:ENSURE-MVN-VERSION can dynamically introspect
       and then load Maven 3 libraries at runtime, ASDF components of type
       MVN can now be used to specify versioned JVM artifacts.

     * Threads spawned by THREADS:MAKE-THREAD can terminate the Lisp image
       via the EXT:QUIT and EXT:EXIT functions.


    Fixes
    -----

     * MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1.10 (ansi test) fixed

     * [ticket #148] READTABLE-CASE :INVERT doesn't work for uninterned symbols

     * [ticket #161] READTABLE-CASE of current readtable affects FASL content

     * [ticket #162] Non-symbol in variable position of SETQ form causes
       class verification failure

     * [ticket #163] Local functions shadow global macro and function bindings
       (fixes PARENSCRIPT support)

     * [ticket 158] Readable printing of the string "#<abc>" does not signal
       a PRINT-NOT-READABLE error anymore

     * Fixed SYNTAX.SHARP-BACKSLASH.6 and SYNTAX.SHARP-BACKSLASH.7

     * Fixed many PPRINT.* test suite failures

     * [ticket #151] LOAD fails for whitespace in JAR-PATHNAME

abcl (0.25.0-1~getdeb1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    Features
    --------

    * Add :resolve-symlinks keyword argument for DIRECTORY.
    * Support -- as a command line parameter for the REPL.
    * Preliminary support for Maven deployment.
    * Add an initargs cache for speedups in check-initargs. This should
      make the initarg checking in CLOS quite a bit faster.
    * Incorporate output of 'svnversion' into LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION.
    * Ant target for generating Javadoc.

    Fixes
    -----
    * [svn r13229] Remove non-existing THREAD-LOCK and THREAD-UNLOCK from
    autoloads.
    * [svn 13228] Fix incorrect elimination of named local functions
      declared inline when they're actually reified in the flet/labels body.
    * [svn r13217] Forward-referenced classes work properly now.
    * [svn r13209] Add initarg checking to REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE.
    * [svn r13204] FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is (more) AMOP compatible.
    * [svn r13203] Create ATOMIC-DEFGENERIC macro, in order to eliminate
      FMAKUNBOUND calls and the resulting windows where no function is bound
      to symbols which are the most essential building blocks in CLOS/AMOP.
    * [svn r13200] Atomically swap generic functions into place of temporary
      DEFUNs for all standard-class slot accessors.
      Note: This addresses the recursive requirement to be able
      to allocate objects and classes while changing the functions
      used to create them.
    * [svn r13196] Provide more context regarding the reason of autoloading.
      Note: This change *hugely* helps debugging.
    * [svn r13189] Fix MACROEXPAND-ALL autoloader which should be
      loaded from 'format.lisp'.
    * [svn r13188] Fix DEFSTRUCT trying to generate accessors named NIL
    * [svn r13187] Fix #125: FASL reader should not convert symbol
      case [Qi FASL loading issues].

      evaluation of :CLASS allocation slot initforms.
    * [svn r13182-r13184] Fix error printing issues.

    -------
    * Merge 'unsafe-p-removal' branch.

abcl (0.24.0-1~getdeb1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    Features
    --------
    * [svn r130103-r13107] Implemented JNULL_REF_P to distinguish a
      JAVA-OBJECT which contains a Java "null" from the Lisp NIL.

    * [svn r13102] More type-conversion helpers in JAVA package:
      LIST-FROM-JARRAY, VECTOR-FROM-JARRAY, and LIST-FROM-JENUMERATION.

    * [svn r13078] JVM::MAKE-CLASS-INTERFACE-FILE provides an interface
      for the creation of Java interfaces as serialized by the new
      classwriter code.  An example of use can be found in
      "examples/misc/dynamic-interfaces.lisp".

    * [svn r13087] Upgraded to ASDF-2.012

    Fixes
    -----
    * [svn r13135] Fix the problem that FASLs can contain
      a limited number of functions.

    * [svn r13117][ticket #117] Fix stack inconsistency error.

    * [svn r13018][ticket #114] Fix strange backtrace growth.

    * [svn r13105] Fix Pathname.java failing to find boot.lisp in an
      "unpacked JAR" situation found by running ABCL in the Glassfish v3
      servlet container.

    * [svn r13096] For arrays, add initialization with the default value
      of the element type if neither INITIAL-ELEMENT nor INITIAL-CONTENT
      have been specified.  Found by: dmalves_ (freenode irc nick).

    * [svn r13094] Eliminate flushes after every character in
      javax.scripting support.

    * [svn r13090] Make --batch exit, use Lisp.exit() in places where
      applicable so that the streams are flushed, hence allowing --eval
      output to be flushed.

    * [svn r13088] Fix algorithim error in writing byte sequences via
      RandomAccessCharacterFile.  Found and fixed by David Kirkman.

    Changes
    -------
    * [svn r13141-13146,13156] Make ABCL a well behaving library to better
      support embedding: NEVER call System.exit() again.  Instead, ABCL now
      throws org.armedbear.lisp.ProcessingTerminated and
      org.armedbear.lisp.IntegrityError.

    * [svn r13111] Added a "tools" directory available in SVN repository
      to contain tools for developing ABCL in various states.  The first
      inhabitant is 'code-grapher.lisp' that provides a prototype to
      diagram a JVM instruction sequence via graphviz.

    * [svn r13101] Reduced verbosity of the AbclScriptEngine.

    * [svn r13097-13100] Slight refactoring of PATHNAME code, further
      specifying URI escaping rules.

    * [svn r13091-2] Better error reporting for UnhandledCondition thrown
      from the Interpreter, storing the originating Java error in the
      "cause" field if the cause is a subclass of JAVA_EXCEPTION.
