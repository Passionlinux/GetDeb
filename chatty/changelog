chatty (0.6.3-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    New features:
    - Popout channels into their own window to be able to view them
    side-by-side
    - Added context menu and improved sorting to Channel Favorites dialog
    - Added check whether window restore position is actually on a screen (if
    not then open on default position)
    - Added Highlight prefix to cutomize color for individual highlight items
      (also added ordering buttons that can be necessary for this feature)
    - Added navigation buttons with page history to Help window
    - Added command to manually refresh emoticons (and badges if you rejoin)
    - Added command to show a list of your subemote codes (better emote

    Changes:
    - Commercials hotkey now simulates a click on the 30s button if the
      Admin Dialog is open on the Commercials tab (so you can also use a
      delay)
    - Added more information to the emote context menu (unfortunately you
    have to right-click on the left side of the emoticon to open it)
    - Changed default access options to all selected (you can still deselect
    them if you don't need them and you think it's safer not having them on
    the token)
    - Decreased scrolling step a bit
    - Improved scroll detection for scrolled up timeout
    - Improved main window title change responsiveness
    - Some small improvements
    - Reorganized and updated help

    Bugfixes:

    - Fixed bug when adding a usercolor (not correctly enabled Done button)
    - Fixed bug canceling the list item edit dialog (highlights/logging)
