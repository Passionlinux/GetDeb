Package: oyranos
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: oyranos-icc (>= ${source:Version}), oyranos-doc (>= ${source:Version})
Description: Colour Management System (CMS) on operating system level (binaries)
 It allows applications and users to match predictably input device colours to 
 output device colours. To do so in a consistent manner, applications and 
 workflows need to support the Oyranos CMS.
 .
 Oyranos is based one the well established ICC standard and various other 
 specifications. System wide settings in Oyranos shall enshure consistency in a 
 portable fashion. Oyranos will provide in the future a Colour Matching Module 
 (CMM) framework. Users can then transparently select a desired colour engine.
 .
 This package contains the binary commands.
