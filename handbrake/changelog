    ---------

    -> Video:

       - updated libx264 (revision 2146)
       - MPEG-2 encoder (from libavcodec)
       - advanced options support for libavcodec encoders
         format: option1=value1:option2=value2
                 -bf 2 -trellis 2 becomes bf=2:trellis=2

    -> Audio:

       - audio gain control (increase/decrease audio volume)

       - updated libogg (1.3.0) and libvorbis (aoTuV b6.03)
       - new AAC encoder (from libavcodec) (considered experimental)
         (supported mixdowns: Mono/Stereo/Dolby, 5.1 will come later)
         (should be on par with faac in terms of quality, sometimes better)
       - FLAC encoder (16-bit, MKV container only)

       - Mac OS X: HE-AAC encoding support, via Core Audio

       - quality-based variable bitrate encoding support
         works with: Lame MP3, Vorbis, Core Audio AAC
         only implemented in CLI and Linux GUI

       - AC3 encoder: set Dolby Surround flag in stream parameters when
       mixdown is Dolby Surround or Pro Logic II


    -> Audio Passthru:

       - DTS Passthru to MP4 container (in addition to MKV) (supported by
       e.g. VLC, MPlayer)
       - DTS-HD Passthru (MP4, MKV containers)
       - MP3 Passthru (MP4, MKV containers)
       - AAC Passthru (MP4, MKV containers)
         (known issue: Magic Cookie not passed through from MPEG
         Program/Transport streams,
          which will break playback in e.g. QuickTime Player)
       - Auto Passthru: one encoder, multiple codecs
         lets you define allowed codecs (from supported passthru codecs)
         lets you pick a fallback encoder if passthru is not possible

    Muxers:
    -------

       - start MKV clusters with a video keyframe whenever possible
         should improve seeking and DLNA streaming

         automatically picks a constant framerate closest to the detected
         average framerate

       - bug fix: fix problem when resolution changes in the middle of a
       video stream

    -> Audio:

       - Blu-ray: make TrueHD, DTS-HD and E-AC3 Secondary Audio streams
       available for decoding and/or passthrough

       - bug fix: libavcodec-decoded streams can now be decoded multiple
       times
                  previously, multiple decodes of the same source tracks
                  weren't possible
                  and audio output tracks had to be dropped

       decoding AC3
