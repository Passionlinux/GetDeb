cgminer (3.9.0-1~getdeb1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - drillbit asic - enable in api.c
    - Fix trivial warnings in knc driver.
    - Reinstate work utility based hashmeter for knc.
    - drillbit format %z not valid on windows
    - drillbit more formatting changes
    - usbutils remove old code added back
    - Memset the spi tx buffer under lock in knc driver.
    - drillbit fix temp display to fit in standard space
    - Drillbit formatting
    - drillbit - use one drvlog and display dname before add_cgpu
    - Keep orginal naming for the bitfury driver
    - knc: Bugfix - good shares wrongly reported as HW errors.   Root cause
    of the
    problem: several work items were assigned the same   work_id in the
    active works
    queue of the knc driver. Thus when good   nonce report arrived from the
    FPGA,
    wrong work item was picked up from   the queue, and submit_nonce
    evaluated that
    as an error.   Fix: Limit the work_id counter update rate. Update it only
    to the
    number of   works actually consumed by the FPGA, not to the number of
    works
    send.
    - Store per-chip submit information for bxf device and show them in the
    API.
    - Check for removed bxf devices before trying to update work or send
    messages.
    - api.c no decref if not json
    - Minimise risk of nonce2 overflow with small nonce2 lengths by always
    encoding
    the work little endian, and increasing the maximum size of nonce2 to 8
    bytes.
    - Change default hashfast timeout to 500ms.
    - Ensure we can look up the work item in the hashfast driver or print out
    an
    error if we don't.
    - Drillbit source formatting - reindent and retabify
    - Add ASIC count, temperature status to drillbit API output (closes #1)
    - Many warning fixes
    - knc: Do not include variable "last minute" data into the "last hour"
    per-core
    stats
    - knc: Make per-core statistics available through API
    - Implement command line control of the bxf target temperature.
    - Add a simple PID-like controller to bi*fury devices to dynamically
    alter the
    clock setting to maintain a nominal target temperature set to 82 degrees.
    - Add data to BXF API output.
    - Add support for newer protocol bi*fury commands job, clock and hwerror,
    setting clock to default 54 value, turning parsing into a compact macro.
    - Look for the thermal overload flag in the gwq status message in the
    hashfast
    driver and send it a shutdown followed by an attempted reset.
    - Log message fixups
    - Fix for "Timing out unresponsive ASIC" for pools which send early
    reconnect
    requests, and then take a short time to send work (ie BTCGuild)
    - Shorten initial config line, win32/pdcurses doesn't like long lines
    during
    early logging
    - Pull back the very long timeouts set in fe478953cf50
    - Fix bug where work restart during results scan could lead to bad device
    state
    - Align device status lines same regardless of number of temp status or
    >10
    ASICs
    - Tag log lines from brand new devices as DRB-1 until they are
    initialised
    - Tag log lines as 'DRB0' rather than 'DRB 0', same as other places in
    cgminer
    - Print a summary of the device settings at level NOTICE during
    initialisation
    - Allow chosing device settings based on 'short' product names shown in
    status
    line
    - Allow per-device settings to use "DRBnn" as an identifier instead
    - Issue an ASIC restart during a work_restart, removes spurious timeout
    messages
    from ASICs and probably some rejected shares
    - Check all results against all work instead of just taking the first
    match
    (avoids some rejected submissions to the pool, ASIC can produce multiple
    candidate results.)
    - Fix memory leak caused by unnecesarily copied work
    - Fix bug with find_settings not returning default value
    - Set timeouts on write, set very long timeouts
    - Merge drillbit driver
