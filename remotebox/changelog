remotebox (1.6-1~getdeb1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - This version brings VirtualBox 4.3.x support and drops support for the
      VirtualBox 4.2.x branch
    - Rebased from GTK 2.22 to GTK 2.24 as a minimum requirement
    - Default rdesktop preference now enables guest sound support and
    clipboard
      sharing.
      rdesktop -r sound:local -r clipboard:PRIMARYCLIPBOARD -T "%n -
      RemoteBox" %h:%p
    - Added preference to automatically add the VBoxAdditions.iso to the
    Virtual
      Media Manager when connecting to a server.
    - Added USB Multi-Touch pointing device support
    - Added RemoteBox preference to set the default RDP Port range for new
    guests
    - Added Discard Saved State toolbutton and menu option
    - Added Clear Connection History menu item to the File menu
    - Added configuration evaulation option to the tools menu of the edit
    settings
      dialog. It evaluates the current guest settings and makes
      recommendations.
    - Added support for attaching SCSI and SAS CD/DVDs to guests
    - Added auto-hint resolution option to preferences
    - Refreshed guest operating system icons
    - Now sets the default RDP port range for new guests created with
    RemoteBox to
      3389-4389, instead of a random port. This makes firewall configuration
      easier
      and VirtualBox will automatically use the next free port to avoid
      conflicts
    - Fixed exception when reading an empty or non-existant guest log
    - Fixed double-line spacing when showing huest logs from Windows servers
    - Fixed a bug when releasing DVD or Floppy media from the VMM. It no
    longer
      removes the virtual floppy or dvd drive, but just ejects the floppy or
      dvd
      image.
    - Fixed several bugs when editing the host-only networks - some outdated
    API
      calls were being used which generated an exception
    - Fixed some path handling bugs affecting Windows
    - Moved hardware virtualization exlusive option from guest settings to
    the
      VirtualBox preferences as it's now a global option in VirtualBox
    - Dropped WinMM audio. Guests using this will automatically be mapped to
    the
      Null audio driver and can't be manually changed to DirectSound if
      required
    - Various GUI tweaks and code optimisations
