kchmviewer (6.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Version 6.1 released
    - Keyboard usability improved thanks to the Giuseppe "Cowo" Corbelli.
    - The focus is now moved to the content page once the link is clicked, so
    the keyboard navigation is available immediately. You can switch the
    focus back by pressing Ctrl+(1-4).
    - Added extended keyboard shortcuts for FindNext and FindPrevious; F3
    still works.
    - Navigation tab window activation (Contents, Search, Index, Bookmarks)
    now automatically focus the proper element.
    - The items in the navigation page now reacts on onItemActivated, and
    hence act on <Return> key and follow the DE policy (such as respecting
    KDE single click).
    - Upon successful search, the focus moves to the results list.
    - Titles are now space-trimmed.
    - Fixed binary TOC parser check which led to crashes for some CHM files.
    - Fixed incorrect settings file storage name when the CHM file contains
    multiple dots.
    - Fixed the Ctrl+click and Shift+click when the release event was
    intercepted by other applications (i.e. GoldenDict)
    - 'Esc' closes the search dialog and restores focus in the content 
    window.
