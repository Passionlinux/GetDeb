fotoxx (14.09-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    This release makes improvements and fixes annoyances in the user
    interface.
    + Dialogs set focus on the main window after use of the [apply] or [next]
      button, so subsequent KB shortcuts will work without extra mouse
      action.
    + File Save: both unsaved metadata edits and image edits are now saved.
      (using [apply] in a metadata dialog saves only the metadata changes).
    + Display "no more images" after deleting the last image in the current 
      gallery (otherwise the window goes inexplicably blank).
    + Additional dialogs now restore previous inputs across sessions.
    + Search Images: if time is omitted in a date/time search range, then 
      00:00 or 23:59 is defaulted for the start or end time respectively.
    + Search Images: new option: find only the latest version of each image.
    + Batch Convert: If image files are renamed or moved with deletion of the
      originals, collections containing the images are updated automatically.
      (The problematic Move Collections function was removed.)
    + Gallery popup images: use the same window or open a new window for each
      thumbnail clicked. The one window option is effectively a combined
      image and gallery view, with adjustable allocation of screen space
      between the two views, and one-click selection of the next image
      to view.
    + Area Select: select by matching colors was made a little smarter.
    + Gallery Selection: scroll selection list to keep new insertions in
      view.
    + New utility function to find and display all duplicate images, fast. 
    + Slide Show: option to auto-replay after reaching the end.
    + Bugfix: Manage Collections: dragging a thumbnail to the bottom of the 
      gallery window would not scroll up if the window was maximized.

fotoxx (14.08-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + The user interface for creating or replacing a collection was improved.
    + Images within a collection can now be rearranged via mouse drag and
    drop.
    + New effect: Make Waves: add random waviness to an image or selected
    area.
    + The Undo/Redo button combined with the 'A' key is Undo/Redo all edits.
    + Editing metadata in RAW images is now allowed (restriction was
    removed).
    + A few non-obvious dialog controls now have popup tips when moused-over.
    + Open Previous File retains zoom size/position to facilitate
    comparisons.
    + The menu icon size is now adjustable in Tools > User Settings.

    2014 Jul 01  v.14.07
    + An image with selected areas can be saved to a PNG file with unselected
      parts transparent. This can be useful in other image editors like Gimp.
    + The main menu was made smaller to save space. Some menu-icons now use
      left/right mouse clicks for two functions, e.g. edit undo/redo. 
    + Mashup: draw lines and arrows on an image, similarly to writing text.
    + Mashup: control of overlapping and transparent images was made easier.
    + A batch upright tool was added - find and upright images turned 90Â°.
    + Panorama: image matching for exposure/color differences was improved.
    + The current image on the gallery page is more strongly highlighted.
    + Raw Therapee was added as a RAW image file processing option.

    + Bugfix: Batch RAW did not set the sRGB color space as default.
    + Bugfix: memory leak in Mashup function.

fotoxx (14.06-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + The Window "tabs" paradigm was revised to improve space utilization.

    + These can also be saved to a file for later re-use. 
    + Make thumbnails automatically for RAW files lacking embedded thumbnails.
    + Panorama: images can be moved and warped with the mouse to fix residual
     alignment offsets (parallax, horizon shift, others).
    + Fix Perspective: move corner markers in 1-pixel steps with the KB arrow
     keys.
    + Trim/Rotate: move trim rectangle in 1-pixel steps with the KB arrow keys.
    + Batch Convert has new controls to sharpen output images.

    + Search Images: select gallery report or tabular report for metadata.
    + Block metadata edits for inappropriate image types (e.g. bmp, gif).
    + Bugfix: Texture function converted RGB 0/0/0 pixels to illegal values.
    + Bugfix: Bogus error message about exceeding geotag limits.
    + Bugfix: Trim function left temporary image remnants on the window.

    + Adjustments for brightness, contrast, color, gamma, and white balance 
      were combined into a single dialog function for faster workflow.
    + Select area: automatically finish areas selected by mouse painting and 
      color matching (process "swiss cheese" selections faster and easier). 
    + Select Area: follow-edge method can better follow edges when mouse
      edge-following is less than perfect.
    + New special effect: add textured surface to an image or selected area.
    + Kuwahara sharpen method added: very effective for some special cases.
    + All sharpen methods were made multithreaded (typical 2x speedup).
    + Slide Show transitions can optionally happen in random sequence.
    + Slide Show transition speeds can be adjusted for CPU/GPU performance.
    + Show RGB: update RGB values live as the mouse is moved over an image.

fotoxx (13.12-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + The user interface has better flexibility for faster workflow:
      + An edit function can be started without closing a prior function.
        The prior edit status is used and an undo/redo position is added.
      + Step through a series of new images with an open edit function. 
        Apply the function to an image or pass over with the [next] button.
      + Brightness and color functions can recall prior settings for faster 
        application to other photos made under the same lighting conditions.
    + RAW files now work like all other image files. Auto-copy to tiff-16
      is no longer done. Edit as usual and save in the desired format. 
    + Add Text: new option: retrieve and edit metadata caption/comments.
    + Captions: new option: show metadata caption/comments above each image.
    + Move Collections more flexible: any pathname segment can be replaced.

  * New upstream version
    + This release focuses on user interface and efficiency improvements.
    + The user manual and F1 help are now available in Castilian Spanish.

      and related image searching should remain fast beyond 500K images.
      A fresh resync of the search index will be done at first startup.

    + RAW files can be opened via menu, command line or drag and drop.
    + RAW files can be seen in thumbnail galleries like other image files.
    + RAW file editing tool Ufraw was integrated into the Fotoxx menu.
    + RAW file batch conversion parameters (dcraw) are user configurable.
    + RAW file batch conversion is faster (about 50/minute on a strong PC).
    + A wavelet denoise method was added (adapted from ufraw/dcraw).
    + Deep color PNG files are supported (16 bits/color).
    + Vignette: center of shading/brightening can be moved with the mouse.

    2012.08.20  v.12.08.1
    + New GUI translation for Catalan is available.
    + Bugfix: bad fflush() call in exiftool_server caused fotoxx to crash
      in some distros using newest c-libraries (observed in Mageia alpha).

    2012.08.01  v.12.08
    + Menus now show a popup description if the mouse dwells on the menu.
    + Auto-synchronization (indexing of new image files) was made optional.
      If disabled, metadata edit and search functions are also disabled.
      These can be restored at any time by synchronizing the image files.
    + The size of a printed image (in centimeters) can be set in advance.

fotoxx (12.06.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    2012.06.01  v.12.06.1
    bugfix: version check for exiftool failed for locales having a comma
    decimal point instead of a period (e.g. 8,60 instead of 8.60). 

    2012.06.01  v.12.06
    + The Spanish and Galician translations were updated (as of v.12.05).
    + Package exiftool version 8.60 or later is now a requirement.
      (this translates into Ubuntu 11.10 or later)
    + New: List geotag groups (city, country, date, image count), click on a 
      group to show a thumbnail gallery, click thumbnails to view or edit.
    + Added and revised geotag locations were separated from the download
    set, 
      to make them easier to keep when changing computers or Linux releases.
    + Geotag search for "null" can be used to find images with go geotags
      (also within other search criteria such as date).
    + New: Voodoo retouch function improves most images with one click.
    + Thumbnail files are now .jpeg instead of .png. Initialization after a
      new install is about 40% faster, and thumbnails are 1/3 as large.
    + There are now three thumbnail options: no thumbnails, thumbnails in the
      image directories (as before), or use a designated thumbnail directory.
    + Flatten Distribution: prevent "color bands" in monotone bright areas.
    + Rotate function user interface was improved and made more responsive.
    + Keyboard shortcuts can be revised and new ones added by the user.
    + Stop popup messages from getting hidden behind other windows.
    + Block "save to file" if an edit dialog is active (unpredictable
    result).
    + Edit history log was moved from EXIF:EditStatus to EXIF:ImageHistory
      because this is the de facto standard.
    + Metadata reports were changed to use EXIF tag names instead of tag
      descriptions. These are needed to directly edit metadata.
    + Slide Show: added continuous loop option (last goes back to first).
    + Trim: new option to start automatically for each new file opened
      (work through a batch of new photos more quickly).
    + Trim: convenience button to do rotate and return to trim.
    + The [prev] and [next] buttons pre-load the next file ahead of need.
      This can speed-up sequential viewing of images on a slow computer.
    + F11 toggles main window to full-screen (no menu/toolbar) and back.
    + Bugfix: geotag retrieval failure with photos from some cameras.
    + Bugfix: Keyboard shortcut T (for Trim) caused a crash.

  * New upstream version
    + Geotagging and reporting was added. Geotags may be entered using city
      names, with substring matching. Click the wanted city from multiple
      candidates. Multiple images can be processed rapidly. Batch processing
      is also available. Search images by city [country] or within radius of
      a given location. Output is a gallery of clickable thumbnails. Select
      locations to assign or search from a world map. Database has 3000+
      cities and others can be added as needed from a web geocoding service.
    + Search Images function was simplified. Searching by date, rating, tags,
      comments, caption, filename, geotags, and any other metadata is in one
      GUI with buttons to select the unusual options.
    + Bugfix: captions and comments with imbedded quotes were causing some
      metadata edits to fail (do nothing).
    + Bugfix: stop GUI lockup if window is resized by user while panorama or
      other composite function is still computing.
    + Bugfix: stop paranoia if an image directory is read-only and thumbnail
      subdirectory cannot be created - just leave out the thumbnails.
    + Bugfix: GUI was too difficult to view and edit the same collection.
