  * New upstream version
     + Compensate GTK API changes in Ubuntu 16.10.
     + Keys F1 (= help) and Escape (= cancel) were made consistent in all
     dialogs.
     + The Select Hairy function and user interface were improved somewhat. 
     + The image search function saves its output to the album
     "search_results"
       (preserve search results when subsequent actions replace the gallery).
     + Batch Add/Remove Tags: the user interface was extended to make it
     easier to choose from existing tags or create new tags as needed.

  * New upstream version
    Image Index:
     + Fotoxx startup is much faster when there are few new image files to
     index. 
       Huge galleries also show much faster. The image index file is
       converted to 
       a new format. The old file is kept for safety, and can be deleted
       later. 
     + Indexing can be completely bypassed if Fotoxx is started from a file
     manager 
       (e.g. Nautilus) to open a selected file, which displays instantly.
       Image
       edits work normally. Search and map functions are disabled because
       they 
       require the image index. The index can be updated on demand or the
       next 
       time Fotoxx starts normally. Set options using Tools > User Options.
    Gallery View:
       Galleries with images from multiple directories (from a search
       function, 
       recent images query, timeline report, etc.) now include the lowest
       level
       directory name in addition to the file name, photo date and thumbnail
       image.
    User Options: view last file version only:
       This option now affect both image file view and gallery view. If set,
       only
       the latest version of each image file is shown, also in gallery pages.
       Albums and results from search functions are not affected.
    Maps:
       A user can optionally use the Mapbox map source by acquiring an access
       key.
       These are free for moderate map usage (50,000 tiles per month). See
       the
       User Guide for a description of the differences and how to obtain a
       key.
    Batch Convert:
       Inserting plugin text in the output file names was simplified. Photo
       dates
       (from EXIF metadata) can be inserted into the output file names.
    Main:
       The user data in /home/<user>/.fotoxx can now be located wherever
       wanted.
       This also enables multiple image collections, managed separately.
    Search:
       The report by location and date-group and the timeline report were
       made 
       more elegant with non-scrolling table headers. Click on a table
       position 
       to get a corresponding thumbnail gallery of images.
    Gallery sort by photo date:
       Multiple edit versions of the same photo were unsorted because they
       all 
       share the same photo date. Resolved by using file mod date as tie
       breaker.
    Bugfix:
     + User Options: If a font was selected that had no monospace
     implementation, 
       some report formats looked horrible. A generic monospace font is now
       used.
     + Gallery sort by photo date was incorrect after editing photo dates.
       (self-corrected after displaying some other gallery and coming back).
     + When saving a modified image as a new file or version, some obscure
     ITPC 
       metadata was not being copied to the new file.
     + Trim/Rotate: the [+90] and [-90] buttons failed when pressed multiple
     times.

       + Timeline report: create a table of image counts by year and month.
         Click on a year/month to produce the corresponding thumbnail
         gallery.
    Color Mode:
       + Sepia coloring was improved.
       + A new slider was added to adjust effect from zero to 100%.
    User Options:
       + Add an option to set the gallery background color.
    Main:
       + The Favorites popup menu is initialized with defaults, if empty.
       + The mouse selection circle remains visible over transparent image
       areas.
    Bugfix:

       selected.
       + Paste Area: brightness and edge blend adjustments reset each-other.

    + New: Select Area Copy: select a hairy or ragged edge with fine control.
    + New: Select Area Find Gap: find the gap in a hand-drawn area outline.
    + Manage Albums: copy and paste from any gallery into an Album gallery
    using 
      parallel Fotoxx sessions (makes album construction and editing easier).

    + Many popup tips were added to dialogs to improve ease of use. 
    + Edit Metadata and Edit Geotags were integrated for better ease of use.
    + Edit Any Metadata: easier to edit items not included in the pick-list.
    + Adjust HSL: improved output quality, more precise user control of
    output.
    + Image Search: finding images with no data (e.g. no tags) was
    simplified.
    + Image Search: search for images from specific locations was simplified.
    + Several functions were made easier to process multiple image files in
    gallery 
      view mode: View and Edit Metadata, Rename, Copy/Move, Delete/Trash,
      Upright.
    + New in image and thumbnail popup menus: jump to image map location.
    + Paint/Clone: undo memory for oldest edits is recovered as needed for
    new edits.
    + Unbend: made easier to use by including icons in the dialog box.
    + Cartoon: small improvement in algorithm, small speedup. 
    + Bugfix: Favorites > Previous Image: crash if initiated from Gallery
    View.
    + Bugfix: Map search range was increasingly inaccurate for higher
    latitudes.
    + Bugfix: Custom favorites menu can lose icons if an entry is deleted.
    + Bugfix: Slide Show: custom image settings (zoom target, transition
    type)
      were sometimes lost if underlying album was edited or rearranged.

  * New upstream version
    + A new image location map was implemented using OpenStreetMap. This has 
      superior functionality, but depends on having a fast and reliable
      internet connection. The old method (using large local map files) can
      still be used and may be preferable for custom maps.
    + New: Selective Rescale: scale image down, leaving selected areas
    unchanged.
      This can be used to increase the relative size of the area of interest.
    + Gallery top panel has more information about current album or search
    view.
    + Font and map marker sizes are adjustable for monitor size and DPI.
    + Bugfix: no warning was given when a gallery thumbnail was opened and
    the previous file had unsaved modifications which were silently
    discarded.
    + Bugfix: minor memory leak in Manage Albums.

    + New: Blur Background: select one or more areas (foreground) that remain
    sharp 
      while the remaining areas (background) are blurred, optionally in
      proportion 
      to distance from foreground. Also useful for the classic Tilt-Shift
      effect.
    + New: Add Transparency: based on brightness, a chosen color, or the
    inverse.
    + Edit Metadata: Editing a series of images that need some of the same
    metadata
      was made faster and easier with a button to recall previous data.
    + The image size limit for most edit functions was doubled to 250
    megapixels
      (not realistic for computers having less than 16 GB main memory). 
    + Select Area: area edge distance calculation was made 2-3x faster.
    + Select Area: copy/paste retains both transparency and edge distance
    data.
    + Calibrate Printer Colors: the chart and the procedure were revised, and
    this
      means you have to perform the calibration again (my apologies for
      this). 
    + Bugfix: Mashup: warping overlay images no longer leaves black margins
    where
      an image was pulled inward from the edge.

    gradually.
    + Brasero was replaced by growisofs for writing image files to
    DVD/BlueRay disc.
      (growisofs underlies Brasero, K3b, and most other disc burning
      utilities).
    + Edit Any Metadata: UI improvement to better handle long text strings.
    + Batch Change Metadata: UI improvement to better handle long text
    strings.

    file 
      with a list of the selected files. Useful to feed shell scripts or
      other apps.
    + Function key changes: F10 for full screen with menu and panel, F11
    without.
    + Batch Convert: overlay images (e.g. credit lines) can be sized for a
    constant
      screen display size, regardless of image size or aspect ratio.
    + When viewing images sequentially using the [prev/next] button or
    keyboard
      arrow keys, adjacent directories can be spanned without user
      navigation.
    + An album can be opened from the command line: $ fotoxx -album

    + New user option: default gallery sort: file name, file mod date, photo
    date.
    + A new function for color saturation was added (separate from Retouch

    files.
    + File Save (New Version): this function can now have a keyboard
    shortcut.
    + Maps: red-dot locations are consolidated only for separations < 100
    meters.
      Previously location names were used, but this is sometimes too broad.
    + Maps: custom user maps are now separated from standard maps. 
      This prevents losing them if the fotoxx-maps package is re-installed.
    + TIFF files are now saved without compression. The file size may be
    slightly
      greater or less, but the processing time is reduced 90%. 
    + Slide Show: new transition: image turns like a book page to reveal next
    image.
    + Bugfix: the Upright function could not step to the next image.
    + Bugfix: PT Panorama was broken due to an interface change in Panorama
    Tools.
    + Bugfix: possible crash when leveling an image by dragging the mouse.
    + Bugfix: possible crash if a select area is abandoned with nothing
    selected.

    + Folders in gallery pages show contained sub-folder and image file
    counts.
    + Pattern: pattern can imprint target image without changing image
    colors.
    + Adjust HSL: the amount of color change is proportional to the match
    with
      a selected target color, and this match range is adjustable.
    + Batch Convert: more flexibility in the formatting of output file names.
    + New: Spherical image projection with variable radius of curvature.
    + Trim/Rotate: if an image is leveled using mouse drag, the trim
    rectangle 
      is automatically maximized, removing the need to do this manually.
    + If an edit dialog is started and left/right image margins are present, 
      the image is pushed to the right side so the dialog can be positioned
      over the expanded left margin and menu panel, to cover less image area.
      
      This position is saved and restored the next time the dialog is used. 
    + Saving to file type .bmp was removed, since all metadata is lost.
    + A new transition type was added to Slide Show: collapsing sphere. 
    + Six other minor improvements and bug fixes.

    + Batch Add/Change Metadata: a pick-list for commonly used tags was
    added.

    + Bugfix: gallery file selection: clicking on a file name in the list of
      selected files was sometimes inaccurate and selected the wrong file.
    + Bugfix: setting geotags by clicking on map locations did not allow an

      clipped at either end, or stretched or flattened in different zones.
    + Editing and searching image tags have an additional tool to better deal
      with a huge list of defined tags. The tag pick-list can be all tags, or
      only those for a tag category chosen from a category pick-list.
    + Select Area: an area cutout can be saved as a PNG or TIF file with a 
      transparency map (alpha channel). Such files can be opened and pasted
      into other images, with transparency working as it should.
    + Image edits: image transparency works as it should. Partly or fully 
      transparent areas can be painted-on or unpainted using the mouse.
    + Mashup: transparency data in overlay images is utilized and editable.
    + New batch tool: add/change/delete any metadata for selected image
    files.
    + Add Text: quickly add the same text at same position to multiple
    images.
    + Gallery thumbnail memory cache is self-limiting to 1 GB main memory.
    + Several small improvements in the user interface and diagnostic
    messages.
    + Bugfix: gallery sort by file modification date used incorrect

  * New upstream version
    + "Rotate 90" was renamed "Upright". A button was added that detects

fotoxx (15.02.1-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    Bugfix: Fotoxx may fail to start after a new install if there are less
    than 200 image files found or if the file "newest_files" has been
    deleted.

fotoxx (15.02-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + The indexing process for newly added image files was made faster: 
      speedup is about 1.2x for a 7200 rpm disk and 1.9x for an SSD.
    + Panorama: a multi-row panorama capability was added by integrating
      Panorama Tools utilities into the Fotoxx menus. Very easy to use.
    + Slide Show: the maximum zoom-in speed was increased by 2x. This is
      significant for a large or high DPI monitor or a slow computer. 
    + Slide Show: the option to show captions/comments can be configured
      per image, and they can be made to vanish after a specified interval.
    + User Settings: Thumbnail size is adjustable over 128/256/512 pixels
      (default 256). 512 is a bit slower but better for a large or high DPI
      monitor, or when viewing gallery pages with thumbnail size at maximum.
    + Mashup: mouse-painted image transparencies are easier to control.
    + Mashup: transparency blends can be set separately for all 4 image
    edges.
    + Cosmetic improvements in gallery view and metadata short report.
    + Startup parameter -nosync was replaced with the more correct -noindex.
    + Bugfix: quick rotate 90 degrees: metadata was not being copied. 
    + Bugfix: crash if switch to gallery view during slide show transition.
    + Bugfix: HDR/HDF/Stack: crash if [cancel] pressed twice rapidly.

    + Reduce Noise: new option: selectively apply to darker image areas.
    + Adding and editing plugins was made easier.
    + Plugins menu was moved from the window left panel into the Edit menu.

fotoxx (14.12-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + Tools > Magnify Image: New function - analogous to inspecting a printed
      image with a magnifying glass that can be moved freely over the image.
    + Tools > User Settings: When stepping through image files with the 
      prev/next button or arrow keys, there is a new option to show only the 
      final edited version (or the original file if never edited).
    + Retouch Combo: The slider to emphasize darker...brighter pixels for
      color adjustments was made more effective.
    + New command parameter -nosync: Allows a faster startup, but search and
      map functions are disabled because of the risk of incorrect results.
      More information is in the Technical Notes section of the User Guide.
    + Select Area: The Finish dialog has a new option to extend the selection
      automatically to designated image corners - a time saver.
    + Slide Show: When paused, the Keyboard M-key starts the magnify
    function.
    + Bugfix: Edit Metadata was not being cancelled when a conflicting
      function was started.

fotoxx (14.11-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + A world map and several larger-scale continental maps are provided in 
      a separate package: fotoxx-maps. These maps show locations of photos
      having geotags. Clicking a map location shows a gallery of thumbnail
      images that can be selected in turn for viewing full size or editing.
      A user may add more maps, and these will work the same way. 
    + Gallery thumbnail popup: expanded speed and functionality for zooming
      thumbnails and comparing images side by side. 
    + Gallery scrolling is smoother and easier to control with the mouse:
      scrolls faster as mouse is dragged closer to top or bottom of window.
    + Sync Gallery can now have a KB shortcut (default 'S' for new installs).
    + Bugfix: Edit Geotags: If the dialog inputs were cleared to blanks, the
      image geotag data was not being erased.

fotoxx (14.09-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    This release makes improvements and fixes annoyances in the user
    interface.
    + Dialogs set focus on the main window after use of the [apply] or [next]
      button, so subsequent KB shortcuts will work without extra mouse
      action.
    + File Save: both unsaved metadata edits and image edits are now saved.
      (using [apply] in a metadata dialog saves only the metadata changes).
    + Display "no more images" after deleting the last image in the current 
      gallery (otherwise the window goes inexplicably blank).
    + Additional dialogs now restore previous inputs across sessions.
    + Search Images: if time is omitted in a date/time search range, then 
      00:00 or 23:59 is defaulted for the start or end time respectively.
    + Search Images: new option: find only the latest version of each image.
    + Batch Convert: If image files are renamed or moved with deletion of the
      originals, collections containing the images are updated automatically.
      (The problematic Move Collections function was removed.)
    + Gallery popup images: use the same window or open a new window for each
      thumbnail clicked. The one window option is effectively a combined
      image and gallery view, with adjustable allocation of screen space
      between the two views, and one-click selection of the next image
      to view.
    + Area Select: select by matching colors was made a little smarter.
    + Gallery Selection: scroll selection list to keep new insertions in
      view.
    + New utility function to find and display all duplicate images, fast. 
    + Slide Show: option to auto-replay after reaching the end.
    + Bugfix: Manage Collections: dragging a thumbnail to the bottom of the 
      gallery window would not scroll up if the window was maximized.

    + Images within a collection can now be rearranged via mouse drag and
    drop.
    + New effect: Make Waves: add random waviness to an image or selected
    area.
    + The Undo/Redo button combined with the 'A' key is Undo/Redo all edits.
    + Editing metadata in RAW images is now allowed (restriction was
    removed).
    + A few non-obvious dialog controls now have popup tips when moused-over.
    + Open Previous File retains zoom size/position to facilitate
    comparisons.
    + The menu icon size is now adjustable in Tools > User Settings.

    + Bugfix: stop spurious extra menu entry in non-english locales.

    2014 Jul 01  v.14.07
    + An image with selected areas can be saved to a PNG file with unselected
      parts transparent. This can be useful in other image editors like Gimp.
    + The main menu was made smaller to save space. Some menu-icons now use
      left/right mouse clicks for two functions, e.g. edit undo/redo. 
    + Mashup: draw lines and arrows on an image, similarly to writing text.
    + Mashup: control of overlapping and transparent images was made easier.
    + A batch upright tool was added - find and upright images turned 90°.
    + Panorama: image matching for exposure/color differences was improved.
    + The current image on the gallery page is more strongly highlighted.
    + Raw Therapee was added as a RAW image file processing option.
    + Metadata and geotag edits were added to the right-click popup menus.

    + Bugfix: file rename could sometimes leave an incorrect thumbnail.
    + Bugfix: Batch RAW did not set the sRGB color space as default.
    + Bugfix: memory leak in Mashup function.

fotoxx (14.06-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + The Window "tabs" paradigm was revised to improve space utilization.

    + These can also be saved to a file for later re-use. 
    + Make thumbnails automatically for RAW files lacking embedded thumbnails.
    + Panorama: images can be moved and warped with the mouse to fix residual
     alignment offsets (parallax, horizon shift, others).
    + Fix Perspective: move corner markers in 1-pixel steps with the KB arrow
     keys.
    + Trim/Rotate: move trim rectangle in 1-pixel steps with the KB arrow keys.
    + Batch Convert has new controls to sharpen output images.
    + Batch Convert RAW has new controls to resize and sharpen output images.
    + Mashup can more easily adjust image overlaps and transparencies.
    + Behave more nicely when running out of disk space.
    + 3 minor bug fixes and a few other minor improvements.

      (thumbnail gallery page fails to update completely)

    + Mashup transparencies can be adjusted instantly as well as gradually.
    + Several small user interface changes were made for convenience and 
      consistency with common practices. Speed was also improved.
    + Keyboard shortcuts editing was simplified.
    + Leverage Edits was removed (this is more easily done with Paint Edits).
    + Edit Translations was removed (unused AFAIK, and slightly buggy).
    + Bugfix: Paint/Clone: ignore source pixels beyond image edge [crash
    risk].

  * New upstream version
    + Index Image Files (aka Synchronize) is faster. Intermixing image files

      Startup time is also faster for the normal case of few new image files.
    + Retouch Combo: sliders were added for fast adjustment of overall 
      brightness and contrast. The curves can then be hand-tuned if needed.

    + Search Images: select gallery report or tabular report for metadata.
    + Block metadata edits for inappropriate image types (e.g. bmp, gif).
    + Bugfix: Texture function converted RGB 0/0/0 pixels to illegal values.
    + Bugfix: Bogus error message about exceeding geotag limits.
    + Bugfix: Trim function left temporary image remnants on the window.

    + Adjustments for brightness, contrast, color, gamma, and white balance 
      were combined into a single dialog function for faster workflow.
    + Select area: automatically finish areas selected by mouse painting and 
      color matching (process "swiss cheese" selections faster and easier). 
    + Select Area: follow-edge method can better follow edges when mouse
      edge-following is less than perfect.
    + New special effect: add textured surface to an image or selected area.

    + A tool was added to remove chromatic abberation (color fringes).
    + Select area by mouse and color: small user interface improvement.
    + More dialogs preserve user inputs within and across Fotoxx sessions.
    + New command line option: start up with a specified menu function.
    + Panorama: option for zero image curve (e.g. to combine scanned images).
    + Gallery is updated live if a file add/delete is done outside Fotoxx.
    + Bugfix: click geotag group >> gallery window sometimes did nothing.

    2012.08.20  v.12.08.1
    + New GUI translation for Catalan is available.
    + Bugfix: bad fflush() call in exiftool_server caused fotoxx to crash
      in some distros using newest c-libraries (observed in Mageia alpha).

    2012.08.01  v.12.08
    + Menus now show a popup description if the mouse dwells on the menu.
    + Auto-synchronization (indexing of new image files) was made optional.
      If disabled, metadata edit and search functions are also disabled.
      These can be restored at any time by synchronizing the image files.
    + The size of a printed image (in centimeters) can be set in advance.
    + A 1-click sepia coloring was added (aged photo effect).
    + If Linux standard trash and desktop trash folder both fail (possible
      with some distros) give the option to simply delete the image file.
    + Painting and scrolling the gallery window was made faster. 
    + Navigating the gallery window to other directories was simplified.
    + A gallery from an image search or collection can be discarded and
      replaced with a directory gallery using a toolbar button.
    + Bugfix: Edit Collections: keep the gallery window scroll position 
      stable when adding or removing images from a collection.
    + Bugfix: If the initial gallery window is list view (no thumbnails), 
      then the gallery window displayed only a blank window. 
    + Bugifx: Crash if a retouch function is "painted" with the mouse and
      and the function is canceled before any change is made.

      Nearby dates can be grouped together. Click a listed group to get a 
      corresponding thumbnail gallery, view or edit images from there.
    + Click a location on a world map, get a corresponding gallery of images.
    + Several small UI improvements in geotag edit and report functions.
    + Bugfix: edit collection: removing images was sometimes not possible if 
      some images still in the collection had been deleted from disk.
    + Bugfix: memory leak if successive images viewed in rapid sequence.
    + Bugfix: Art > Dots treatment was destroyed when saved to a file.

fotoxx (12.06.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    2012.06.01  v.12.06.1
    bugfix: version check for exiftool failed for locales having a comma
    decimal point instead of a period (e.g. 8,60 instead of 8.60). 

    2012.06.01  v.12.06
    + The Spanish and Galician translations were updated (as of v.12.05).
    + Package exiftool version 8.60 or later is now a requirement.
      (this translates into Ubuntu 11.10 or later)
    + New: List geotag groups (city, country, date, image count), click on a 
      group to show a thumbnail gallery, click thumbnails to view or edit.
    + Added and revised geotag locations were separated from the download
    set, 
      to make them easier to keep when changing computers or Linux releases.
    + Geotag search for "null" can be used to find images with go geotags
      (also within other search criteria such as date).
    + New: Voodoo retouch function improves most images with one click.
    + Thumbnail files are now .jpeg instead of .png. Initialization after a
      new install is about 40% faster, and thumbnails are 1/3 as large.
    + There are now three thumbnail options: no thumbnails, thumbnails in the
      image directories (as before), or use a designated thumbnail directory.
    + Flatten Distribution: prevent "color bands" in monotone bright areas.
    + Rotate function user interface was improved and made more responsive.
    + Keyboard shortcuts can be revised and new ones added by the user.
    + Stop popup messages from getting hidden behind other windows.
    + Block "save to file" if an edit dialog is active (unpredictable
    result).
    + Edit history log was moved from EXIF:EditStatus to EXIF:ImageHistory
      because this is the de facto standard.
    + Metadata reports were changed to use EXIF tag names instead of tag
      descriptions. These are needed to directly edit metadata.
    + Slide Show: added continuous loop option (last goes back to first).
    + Trim: new option to start automatically for each new file opened
      (work through a batch of new photos more quickly).
    + Trim: convenience button to do rotate and return to trim.
    + The [prev] and [next] buttons pre-load the next file ahead of need.
      This can speed-up sequential viewing of images on a slow computer.
    + F11 toggles main window to full-screen (no menu/toolbar) and back.
    + Bugfix: geotag retrieval failure with photos from some cameras.
    + Bugfix: Keyboard shortcut T (for Trim) caused a crash.

fotoxx (12.05-1~getdeb2~precise) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + Geotagging and reporting was added. Geotags may be entered using city
      names, with substring matching. Click the wanted city from multiple
      candidates. Multiple images can be processed rapidly. Batch processing
      is also available. Search images by city [country] or within radius of
      a given location. Output is a gallery of clickable thumbnails. Select
      locations to assign or search from a world map. Database has 3000+
      cities and others can be added as needed from a web geocoding service.
    + Search Images function was simplified. Searching by date, rating, tags,
      comments, caption, filename, geotags, and any other metadata is in one
      GUI with buttons to select the unusual options.
    + Bugfix: captions and comments with imbedded quotes were causing some
      metadata edits to fail (do nothing).
    + Bugfix: stop GUI lockup if window is resized by user while panorama or
      other composite function is still computing.
    + Bugfix: stop paranoia if an image directory is read-only and thumbnail
      subdirectory cannot be created - just leave out the thumbnails.
    + Bugfix: GUI was too difficult to view and edit the same collection.

    + New: Erase an object by overpainting with selected background.
    + New: Vignette Tool: change brightness or color in a radial pattern.
    + Art > Tiles: an optional 3D depth effect was added.
    + Edit Pixels: do area edge blending same as other edit functions.
    + Gamma Curve: buttons [++] etc. added as in brightness/color curves.
    + Select Area: "tweak" mode added: nudge an edge line using the mouse.
    + White Balance: slider added to adjust the impact from 0 to 100%.
    + Gallery window navigation was made a little more flexible.
    + First time startup: initial thumbnail creation and image file indexing
      is 2x faster (2000+ images/min. on a strong PC with 4 cpu cores).
    + New: Help > Log File: view the current (live) log file.
    + Memory allocation failure: no crash, exit with a reasonable message.
    + Bugfix: rare crash when a concurrent edit function completes.
