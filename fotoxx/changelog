    + New art function: transform a photo into a cartoon-like drawing.

      (from EXIF). Displayed date is determined by the sort.

      and longitude were left at "null" (i.e. values never input). 
    + Bugfix: Open RAW from a gallery thumbnail left popup permanently open.
    + Bugfix: Window width sometimes impossible to reduce without restart.

    2013.01.11  v.13.01.2

      clicks which can cause accidental displacement of the menu entries.
    + Brightness histogram: add "overall" graph to existing R/G/B graphs.

fotoxx (12.10-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + This release focuses on user interface and efficiency improvements.
    + The user manual and F1 help are now available in Castilian Spanish.
    + The search index was revised for greater scalability. Metadata edits 
      and related image searching should remain fast beyond 500K images.
      A fresh resync of the search index will be done at first startup.
    + A custom graphic menu in a popup window was implemented. Frequently 
      used functions can be added and the layout arranged to taste.

fotoxx (12.09.1-1~getdeb2) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    2012.09.01  v.12.09.1

    2012.09.01  v.12.09
    + RAW files can be opened via menu, command line or drag and drop.
    + RAW files can be seen in thumbnail galleries like other image files.
    + RAW file editing tool Ufraw was integrated into the Fotoxx menu.
    + RAW file batch conversion parameters (dcraw) are user configurable.
    + RAW file batch conversion is faster (about 50/minute on a strong PC).
    + A wavelet denoise method was added (adapted from ufraw/dcraw).
    + Deep color PNG files are supported (16 bits/color).
    + Vignette: center of shading/brightening can be moved with the mouse.
    + Images can be copied to the clipboard with a right-click popup menu.
    + Trim: target circle added in the middle of the trim rectangle.

    + Bugfix: click geotag group >> gallery window sometimes did nothing.

    2012.08.20  v.12.08.1
    + New GUI translation for Catalan is available.
    + Bugfix: bad fflush() call in exiftool_server caused fotoxx to crash
      in some distros using newest c-libraries (observed in Mageia alpha).

    2012.08.01  v.12.08
    + Menus now show a popup description if the mouse dwells on the menu.
    + Auto-synchronization (indexing of new image files) was made optional.
      If disabled, metadata edit and search functions are also disabled.
      These can be restored at any time by synchronizing the image files.
    + The size of a printed image (in centimeters) can be set in advance.

fotoxx (12.06.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    2012.06.01  v.12.06.1
    bugfix: version check for exiftool failed for locales having a comma
    decimal point instead of a period (e.g. 8,60 instead of 8.60). 

    2012.06.01  v.12.06
    + The Spanish and Galician translations were updated (as of v.12.05).
    + Package exiftool version 8.60 or later is now a requirement.
      (this translates into Ubuntu 11.10 or later)
    + New: List geotag groups (city, country, date, image count), click on a 
      group to show a thumbnail gallery, click thumbnails to view or edit.
    + Added and revised geotag locations were separated from the download
    set, 
      to make them easier to keep when changing computers or Linux releases.
    + Geotag search for "null" can be used to find images with go geotags
      (also within other search criteria such as date).
    + New: Voodoo retouch function improves most images with one click.
    + Thumbnail files are now .jpeg instead of .png. Initialization after a
      new install is about 40% faster, and thumbnails are 1/3 as large.
    + There are now three thumbnail options: no thumbnails, thumbnails in the
      image directories (as before), or use a designated thumbnail directory.
    + Flatten Distribution: prevent "color bands" in monotone bright areas.
    + Rotate function user interface was improved and made more responsive.
    + Keyboard shortcuts can be revised and new ones added by the user.
    + Stop popup messages from getting hidden behind other windows.
    + Block "save to file" if an edit dialog is active (unpredictable
    result).
    + Edit history log was moved from EXIF:EditStatus to EXIF:ImageHistory
      because this is the de facto standard.
    + Metadata reports were changed to use EXIF tag names instead of tag
      descriptions. These are needed to directly edit metadata.
    + Slide Show: added continuous loop option (last goes back to first).
    + Trim: new option to start automatically for each new file opened
      (work through a batch of new photos more quickly).
    + Trim: convenience button to do rotate and return to trim.
    + The [prev] and [next] buttons pre-load the next file ahead of need.
      This can speed-up sequential viewing of images on a slow computer.
    + F11 toggles main window to full-screen (no menu/toolbar) and back.
    + Bugfix: geotag retrieval failure with photos from some cameras.
    + Bugfix: Keyboard shortcut T (for Trim) caused a crash.

fotoxx (12.05-1~getdeb2~precise) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + Geotagging and reporting was added. Geotags may be entered using city
      names, with substring matching. Click the wanted city from multiple
      candidates. Multiple images can be processed rapidly. Batch processing
      is also available. Search images by city [country] or within radius of
      a given location. Output is a gallery of clickable thumbnails. Select
      locations to assign or search from a world map. Database has 3000+
      cities and others can be added as needed from a web geocoding service.
    + Search Images function was simplified. Searching by date, rating, tags,
      comments, caption, filename, geotags, and any other metadata is in one
      GUI with buttons to select the unusual options.
    + Bugfix: captions and comments with imbedded quotes were causing some
      metadata edits to fail (do nothing).
    + Bugfix: stop GUI lockup if window is resized by user while panorama or
      other composite function is still computing.
    + Bugfix: stop paranoia if an image directory is read-only and thumbnail
      subdirectory cannot be created - just leave out the thumbnails.
    + Bugfix: GUI was too difficult to view and edit the same collection.

    + Art > Tiles: an optional 3D depth effect was added.
    + Edit Pixels: do area edge blending same as other edit functions.
    + Gamma Curve: buttons [++] etc. added as in brightness/color curves.
    + Select Area: "tweak" mode added: nudge an edge line using the mouse.
    + White Balance: slider added to adjust the impact from 0 to 100%.
    + Gallery window navigation was made a little more flexible.
    + First time startup: initial thumbnail creation and image file indexing
      is 2x faster (2000+ images/min. on a strong PC with 4 cpu cores).
    + New: Help > Log File: view the current (live) log file.
    + Memory allocation failure: no crash, exit with a reasonable message.
    + Bugfix: rare crash when a concurrent edit function completes.
