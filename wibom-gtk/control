Description: Wine bottle management
 Wine is the program for running applications for Microsoft Windows on
 other operating systems, primary on GNU/Linux. This program creates
 in the user's home directory a folder called .wine containing user
 preferences, the simplified version of Windows registers and files
 structure of simulated disk C:. Many Wine users don't know there
 can be more those folders coexisting. They are called bottles.
 Because of bottles it is possible to have a few isolated
 instances of “Pseudowindows” on one system.
