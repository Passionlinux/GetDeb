Description: Frontend to reverse VNC connections
 Gitso is a frontend to reverse VNC connections. It is meant to be
 a simple two-step process that connects one person to another's screen.
 First, the support person offers to give support. Second, the person who
 needs help connects and has their screen remotely visible. Because
 Gitso is cross-platform (Linux, OS X and Windows) and uses a reverse
 VNC connection, it greatly simplifies the process of getting support.
