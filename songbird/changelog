  NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS
    Automatically Organize Library Files
      Songbird can now automatically organize the files that are contained in
      your library. Once enabled, it will consolidate your media in one
      location. You can customize the structure of the folder and file
      names based on metadata contained in every track.

    2-Way iTunes Import/Export
      If you’re using iTunes Music Store to purchase content, you can now
      automatically expose iTunes library tracks and playlists into Songbird.
      You can also export tracks and playlists added to Songbird back into
      iTunes, so that they can easily be synced to your iPhone or iPod touch.

    Last.fm Radio
      Last.fm Radio supports artist, tag, and user stations, mapping station
      links on the Last.fm website to play internally in Songbird. It
      includes the Radio Directory allowing you to conveniently browse and
      explore the tag and artist relationships on Last.fm. Additionally, the
      Radio directory includes quick links for playing stations based on your
      Last.fm library, your Songbird library, and friends/neighbors’ libraries.

    10-band Equalizer
      Now you can tweak the frequency response of the audio playback to
      match your room’s acoustics or your personal preferences.

  KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES
  Below are the high profile bugs/issues which are known to still be open for
  this release.  You can also check the Common Duplicates page for lesser
  profile known issues.

    NOTE: 
      For playback of DRM-encrypted files, make sure you have gone to store
      from which you purchased those tracks to learn how to authorize your
      computer to play them.  Songbird will be able to play DRM-encrypted
      tracks as soon as your machine has been authorized.

      The following are not yet supported by Songbird (will be planned for
      future releases):
        Video Import and Playback, Podcast Subscriptions and Playback,
        CD Rip and Burn

      We've attempted to address the requests for native iPhone and iPod
      Touch support by including the two-way iTunes synchronization feature.
      Let us know how this alternative is working for you.

    All Platforms
      The interaction between Watch Folders and Manage Music can cause
      duplicates to appear in the library when the Watch Folder is also the
      Manage Music folder. Users should refrain from setting the Watch Folder
      and the Manage Music folder to the same location to avoid this
      situation. ( bug 16641)

      The interaction between Manage Music and iTunes' Consolidate Library
      feature can cause "ghost tracks" to be imported into Songbird. Users
      should only use one application to manage their music library to avoid
      this problem. ( bug 16641)

      Dialogs text cropped when OS is using big fonts ( bug 5583)

      Window min/max sizing does not respect DPI ( bug 6956)

      [iPod] Album Artwork switched to wrong music ( bug 7780)

      [metadata-writing] Unable to write metadata to .m4a files ( bug 8812)

      [ipod] 1st Gen iPod shuffle not mounting in Songbird ( bug 10432)
        Temp Solution:
          Go to iPod directory
          Find "ipod_control" folder and delete it
          Re-connect the ipod and Songbird will recognize it.

      searching returns unexpected results ( bug 13435)

      Paused tracks intermittently increase playcount ( bug 13615)

      iTunes smart playlists aren't imported ( bug 16473)

    Windows Specific
      Cannot playback media items on MTP device from within Songbird app
      ( bug 8068)

      Some songs display as 0:00 ( bug 9145)

      Same files can be added twice to a device if 2 PCs are used ( bug 9803)

      Syncs involving large number of files pick up spurious files to copy
      ( bug 15728)

    Linux Specific
      [linux] Mini mode position is not remembered when switched back from
      Full Player ( bug 5938)

      Maximized state is not remembered between feather changes ( bug 9002)

      [podcast][mac][linux] Play stopped on change of feather ( bug 9525)

      [mac][linux] Songbird does not play MIDI files ( bug 9798)

      [linux] Cannot D&D import files from directory with spaces it path name
      ( bug 9804)

      [linux] Files from SMB shares cannot be played ( bug 12539)

      Songbird won't play music under Fedora 10/Songbird does not work on
      Fedora 10 ( bug 15235)

    MacOSX Specific
      [mac][ipod] iTunes can interfere with mount of iPod in Songbird
      ( bug 6946)

      [podcast][mac][linux] Play stopped on change of feather ( bug 9525)

      [mac][linux] Songbird does not play MIDI files ( bug 9798)

      [mac] Mini-player doesn't show up in Spaces (intermittent) ( bug 9819)

  - BUGS FIXED IN THIS UPDATE
    * Volume changes between tracks
      The problem documented in bug 15751 caused Songbird to change playback
      volume between tracks with different sample rates.  

    * Crash on exit in Windows
      Songbird will no longer crash on exit bug 15642. This was an
      intermittent problem that did not affect all Songbird users on Windows.

    * Media deleted from iPod during Songbird update 
      The bug that caused media to be deleted from iTunes-managed iPods
      during a Songbird update was fixed with an add-on update ( bug 15640).
      This Songbird update has an updated add-on block list to ensure that
      the buggy version of the add-on cannot be loaded by the application
      ( bug 15788).

songbird (1.1.1-1~getdeb1) intrepid; urgency=low

  - NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS
    * On Demand Fetching of Album Artwork
      * Songbird can now fetch album artwork from the web at your command.
        Simply select or right-click a track and choose "Get Album Artwork".
        You can also select your preferred source of artwork. By default,
        Songbird will retrieve album art from Last.fm but you can install
        from other sources such as amazon.com via an add-on.

    * MTP Device Support 
      * We fixed many bugs affecting MTP devices on Windows. We've also added
        the ability to synch authorized Windows Media DRM'ed content to your
        MTP device. To see if your MTP device is supported, or to report your
        findings, visit our MTP Device Support page.
    * Watch Folders
      * You can choose to watch a folder hierarchy for changes and the
        content will auto-magically be imported in your library. If a file is
        removed from the watched folder, the corresponding track will be
        deleted from your Library.

    * Better Sorting
      * Library sorting supports unicode collation and better handling of
        leading definite and indefinite articles such as "The" and "a".

    * Replay Gain Support (Normalization)
      * If a track's metadata contains replay gain (including
        iTunes-specific) information, Songbird will adjust the playback
        gain appropriately.

    * Reduced Installer Packages
      * We've reduced the installer package size on Mac and Linux by about
        45% on each of those platforms.

    * Improved Memory Usage/Performance
      * As part of our project to bring down memory usage in Songbird, we've
        re-tuned the database to be less greedy with your system's memory.
        On some memory starved systems, this should actually increase
        performance, but most users shouldn't notice any difference in
        searching, sorting, scrolling, filtering, or smart playlists.
        Users with very large libraries (>100,000 tracks) will see the
        biggest memory use improvements. If you do find things are more
        sluggish than you remember, please see Tuning Songbird Memory
        Usage and try adjusting the page cache size upwards. If you find
        any problems in these areas, please file a Bugzilla issue
        against Songbird.

    * 7digital MP3 Store Add-on (Beta)
      * We've partnered with 7digital to bring you the highest quality MP3s
        (320kbps). You can easily search, purchase, organize and get
        recommendations directly into Songbird.  Just click on the 7digital
        Music Store node in your Songbird service pane. NOTE: The UK store is
        fully stocked, but the US and other European stores are still
        continuing to populate a complete catalog of music.  Please file any
        bugs, issues or suggestions for the 7digital MP3 store specifically
        in our Bugzilla database.

songbird (1.0.0-0~getdeb1) intrepid; urgency=low

  - Improved Audio/Playback Functionality
    * We now use GStreamer as our main media playback
      system, across all platforms - giving us higher
      performance, better reliability, and a platform
      for much more media-related functionality
      in the future.  
    * Songbird supports MP3, FLAC, and Vorbis on all
      platforms; WMA on Windows; and AAC on Windows and Mac

      supported per platform can be viewed via
      "Keyboard Shortcuts" selection in the Help menu.
    * We've refined the column heading property list and
      made it easier to enable the properties you care
      about. Just right click on any column heading in a
      library or playlist to give it a try. 
    * "Show File" now available for any selected track via
      File menu or right click on track contextual menu.
      This provides an easy way to find the media file
      location on your filesystem.
    * Smart Playlists can now be used as rules within other
      Smart Playlists.
    * Ability to show/hide display panes via individual
      buttons for service pane, bottom and right sidebar
      display panes
