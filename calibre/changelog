    details.
  * Refresh patches to apply cleanly.
  * debian/control: Bump python-cssutils to >= 0.9.7~ to ensure the existence

calibre (0.5.14+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules, get-orig-source: Do not unpack newly generated orig tarball
    if we don't have unpackaged upstream sources in the tree (such as when

calibre (0.5.11+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Drop Ubuntu specific python-mechanize binary dependency as
    well (brown paperbag). (Closes: #525612)

calibre (0.5.9+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #525339)
  * manpages-installation.patch: Encode generated manpages as UTF-8, to avoid
    UnicodeDecodeErrors when writing them out to files.
  * debian/control: Demote calibre dependency of calibre-bin to Recommends:,
    which is sufficient and avoids a circular dependency. (Closes: #522059)
  * debian/control: Drop build dependency help2man, current version does not
    need it any more.
  * debian/control: Drop versioned build dependency on python-mechanize,
    current sid version is enough.
  * debian/rules: Copy "setup.py install" command from cdbs'
    python-distutils.mk, since the current version broke this. This is a
    hackish workaround until #525436 gets fixed.

    any more.
