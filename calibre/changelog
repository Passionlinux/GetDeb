  * debian/control: Demote calibre dependency of calibre-bin to Recommends:,
    which is sufficient and avoids a circular dependency. (Closes: #522059)
  * debian/control: Drop build dependency help2man, current version does not
    need it any more.
  * debian/control: Drop versioned build dependency on python-mechanize,
    current sid version is enough.
  * debian/rules: Copy "setup.py install" command from cdbs'
    python-distutils.mk, since the current version broke this. This is a
    hackish workaround until #525436 gets fixed.
  * debian/rules: Drop using $(wildcard ), use `ls`; the former does not work
    any more.
