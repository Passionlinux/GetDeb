  * New upstream version
    In addition to bug fixes, this stable release includes one important 
    new feature introduced after the last stable release:
    This release of DrJava should successfully load the Java 8 compiler
    when DrJava is run using a Java 8 JDK.
    Notes:
    (i) Java 5 compatibility has been dropped. To use DrJava, you will
    need Java 6 or newer.
    (ii) The Mac OS X app is configured to use Apple Java 6, the last Java
    release developed by Apple. Subsequent Oracle releases of Java
    for Mac OS X use a different, incompatible app launcher. DrJava
    can be run using an Oracle JDK on Mac OS X by downloading the
    jar file version of DrJava and invoking it from the command
    line. In some cases, simply clicking on the jar file icon will
    start DrJava.
    (iii) Recent versions of Mac OS X include a gatekeeper that declares
    unlicensed apps (like DrJava and most other open source apps) as
    "corrupt" and suggests that they be deleted. Many users report
    that this happens when attempting to open the DrJava app (even
    though it uses Apple's app launcher) the first time.
    Nevertheless, the app can be opened manually and will 
    subsequently open normally.
    (iv) This release of DrJava supports the editing and compilation of 
    Java 8 programs but it does not yet support new Java 8 syntax
    in the interactions pane. We anticipate that a forthcoming
    release will have this capability.
    (v) DrJava currently triggers a JVM bug in the Oracle releases of
    Java 7 and 8 on Linux. The bug prints a JVM crash message on
    the console (typically the terminal from which DrJava is
    started), but DrJava still appears to start normally. Java must
    restart in most configurations (depending on your saved DrJava
    preferences) because many critical parameters of the JVM
    including the classpath, maximum heap size, and maximum stack
    size must be specified at startup and cannot be changed. The
    Oracle Java 7/8 JVM does not crash in DrJava until after the
    restart operation (spawning a new JVM) has been executed, so
    only the display of the DrJava splash banner fails as a result
    of the crash.
